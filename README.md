# Dynamic-Object-Removal-and-Inpainting
A Visual SLAM system improved with Dynamic object removal and inpainting the scene. 

The project aims to segment dynamic objects in the video, remove them  from the frames, and further inpaint these frames with background as we donâ€™t want dynamic objects to be used for camera localization and to be included in the final reconstructed map of the scene.This project focuses on two major aspects, Dynamic Object Segmentation and Video Inpainting. The Project tries to improve the SLAM system with efficient and accurate learning based methods built upon the baseline DynaSLAM- [https://github.com/BertaBescos/DynaSLAM](https://github.com/BertaBescos/DynaSLAM).

The Project is divided into two phases:
1. Dynamic Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation
2. Video Inpainting

## Dynamic Object Detection and Semantic Segmentation

To achieve the dynamic object detection on certain dynamic object classes such as Humans, Birds etc. we fine tune a pre trained Transformer model called Segmenter building upon the baseline code ([Source Code](https://github.com/rstrudel/segmenter)). 

**Install** the environment according to above source and place the segmenter folder in the directory where the below notebooks are run. Also, please refer to instructions inside the ipynb files for the config files need to be replaced with source configs before performing transfer learning

The Integrated Code Implementation done to achieve this task can be accessed through [Jupyter Notebook](sem_seg_trans.ipynb).

Also, the Loss Curves and Precision Curves are inferred for different datasets when fine tuned the pre trained Model. The Source Notebook Can be found [here](Transfer_Learning.ipynb)

## Video Inpainting

To improve the Background reconstruction quality after dynamic object removal upon the exisiting implementation of DynaSLAM we use Inpainting Technique called ProPainter building upon the baseline code ([Source Code](https://github.com/sczhou/ProPainter)).

To run inference using Propainter, sequences from TUM RGBD Dataset/custom Data require preprocessing(Resizing,sequencing images etc).The code used for data processing is provided [here](Data_PreProcessing/).
